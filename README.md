Overview

This repository provides the official implementation and experimental code accompanying the manuscript:

“Comparative Analysis of GAN Architectures for Enhanced Underwater Image Quality and Efficiency”
Submitted to The Visual Computer (Springer Nature)

The goal of this work is to conduct a systematic and reproducible comparison of two representative GAN-based underwater image enhancement models:

Sea-Pix-GAN – a wide U-Net–based architecture emphasizing structural fidelity

MuLA-GAN – a lightweight attention-driven architecture optimized for efficiency

Underwater images suffer from severe degradation due to light absorption, wavelength-dependent attenuation, and scattering. These effects reduce contrast, distort color balance, and obscure structural details, negatively impacting downstream tasks such as marine monitoring and autonomous navigation.

This repository enables researchers to reproduce all reported experiments, evaluate quantitative metrics, and inspect qualitative results across multiple benchmark datasets.
